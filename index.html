    <h1>Timeline of Jim's History</h1>

    <h2>Creation of Jim</h2>
    <p>One night, Emmettdaster, feeling both tired and inspired, decided to create something on MS Paint. In just 15 seconds, he sketched a random figure and named it Jim. Little did Emmett know that this seemingly insignificant creation would soon become an iconic character.</p>

    <h2>Discovery by Kaden</h2>
    <p>Initially, Jim sat on the desktop of the server, unnoticed, until Kaden discovered him and introduced him to the rest of the group.</p>

    <h2>Growing Popularity</h2>
    <p>Over time, Jim gained some popularity, and the group started sharing his image as a JPEG file in the group chat. As Jim's fame grew, so did the number of variants created.</p>

    <h2>Dedicated Discord Server</h2>
    <p>Eventually, the group decided to create a dedicated Discord server to celebrate Jim's legacy. Jim himself even acquired a Discord account, cementing his presence within the community.</p>

    <h2>Continuing Legacy</h2>
    <p>Today, Jim continues to thrive within the server, bringing joy to those who know him. His legacy serves as a testament to the power of creativity and the lasting impact of a simple character born on a late-night MS Paint session.</p>
